An introduction to Frontend
===========================

Welcome to **An introduction to Frontend**.

The course covers:

- HTML, CSS and Javascript basics
- DOM manipulation with [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- Quickly prototyping (e.g. [Twitter Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/))
- Dependency management with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Task runner (e.g. [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/))
- CSS preprocessor (e.g. [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/))

All [slides](./An%20introduction%20to%20Frontend%20-%202019%20Edition%20(with%20Bootstrap%204).pdf) have been prepared and used by me while teaching a course on Frontend basics and are available on speakerdeck.
