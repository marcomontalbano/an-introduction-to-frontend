# An introduction to Frontend

Welcome to **An introduction to Frontend**.

The course covers:

- HTML, CSS, and Javascript (ES6) basics
- DOM manipulation with [Vanilla JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- Dependency management with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Task runner (e.g. [Parcel](https://en.parceljs.org/))
- CSS preprocessor (e.g. [Scss](https://sass-lang.com/))

[Here](https://marcomontalbano.github.io/an-introduction-to-frontend) you can find what my course aims to create.

All slides have been prepared and used by me while teaching a course on Frontend basics and are available on speakerdeck.
