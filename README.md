An introduction to Frontend for beginners
=========================================

Welcome to **An introduction to Frontend for beginners**.

This repository contains a `live-action` folder with all examples used during the course.
It also contains an `exercise` folder for homeworks :smile:.

The course is divided in 3 modules: 
1. [Frontend Overview] - HTML, CSS and Javascript basics. 
2. [Make a Website] - DOM Manipulation, jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. 
3. [Automation] - Less, Node.js, NPM, Bower and Gruntjs

All slides have been prepared and used by me while teaching a course on Frontend basics in Italian.

If you need an English version, please contact me.
